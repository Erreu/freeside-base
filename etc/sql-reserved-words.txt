What are the SQL reserved words? 

I grep'd the following list out of the sql docs available via anonymous ftp to speckle.ncsl.nist.gov:/isowg3.
SQL3 words are not set in stone, but you'd do well to avoid them. 

    From sql1992.txt:

         AFTER, ALIAS, ASYNC, BEFORE, BOOLEAN, BREADTH,
         COMPLETION, CALL, CYCLE, DATA, DEPTH, DICTIONARY, EACH, ELSEIF,
         EQUALS, GENERAL, IF, IGNORE, LEAVE, LESS, LIMIT, LOOP, MODIFY,
         NEW, NONE, OBJECT, OFF, OID, OLD, OPERATION, OPERATORS, OTHERS,
         PARAMETERS, PENDANT, PREORDER, PRIVATE, PROTECTED, RECURSIVE, REF,
         REFERENCING, REPLACE, RESIGNAL, RETURN, RETURNS, ROLE, ROUTINE,
         ROW, SAVEPOINT, SEARCH, SENSITIVE, SEQUENCE, SIGNAL, SIMILAR,
         SQLEXCEPTION, SQLWARNING, STRUCTURE, TEST, THERE, TRIGGER, TYPE,

The following are new reserved words in MySQL 5.5:
GENERAL 	IGNORE_SERVER_IDS 	MASTER_HEARTBEAT_PERIOD
MAXVALUE 	RESIGNAL 	SIGNAL
SLOW 	  	 

MySQL permits some keywords to be used as unquoted identifiers because many people previously used them. Examples are those in the following list:

    *

      ACTION
    *

      BIT
    *

      DATE
    *

      ENUM
    *

      NO
    *

      TEXT
    *

      TIME
    *

      TIMESTAMP
