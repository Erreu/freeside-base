This collection of files implements a 'self-administered mail service.'
Configuration is similar to fs_signupd

Additionally you will need to modify the database:

CREATE TABLE svc_acct_admin (
  svcnum int primary key,
  adminsvc int not null
);

creating both as keys might be good

(and perform the dbdef-create)


As it exists now, a package containing one svc_domain, at least one
svc_acct_admin, and other services can have its svc_acct's and svc_forward's
manipulated by the svc_acct referenced by a svc_acct_admin in the package.

One svc_acct may be referenced as svc_acct_admin for multiple packages.

fs_mailadmin_server contains hard coded references to service numbers which
will require editing for your system.

It's not a lot, but it might provide inspiration.
