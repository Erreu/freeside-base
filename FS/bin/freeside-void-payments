=head1 NAME

freeside-void-payments - Automatically void a list of returned payments.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  freeside-void-payments [ -f file | [ -s start-date ] [ -e end-date ] ] [ -r 'reason' ] [ -g gatewaynum | -a agentnum ] [ -c ] user

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Voids payments that were returned by the payment processor.  Can be 
run periodically from crontab or manually after receiving a list of 
returned payments.  Normally this is a meaningful operation only for 
electronic checks.

This script voids payments based on the combination of gateway (see 
L<FS::payment_gateway>) and authorization number, since this is 
generally how the processor will identify them later.

  -f: Read the list of authorization numbers from the specified file.  
      If they are not from the default payment gateway, -g or -a 
      must be given to identify the gateway.
      
  If -f is not given, the script will attempt to contact the gateway 
  and download a list of returned transactions.  To support this, 
  the Business::OnlinePayment module for the processor must implement 
  the I<get_returns()> method.  For an example, see 
  L<Business::OnlinePayment::WesternACH>.

  -s, -e: Specify the starting and ending dates for the void list.  
      This has no effect if -f is given.  The end date defaults to 
      today, and the start date defaults to one day before the end date.

  -r: The reason for voiding the payments, to be stored in the database.

  -g: The L<FS::payment_gateway> number for the gateway that handled 
      these payments.  If -f is not given, this determines which 
      gateway will be contacted.  This overrides -a.

  -a: The agentnum whose default gateway will be used.  If neither -a 
      nor -g is given, the system default gateway will be used.

  -c: Use the default gateway for check transactions rather than 
      credit cards.

A warning will be emitted for each transaction that can't be found.  
This may happen if it's already been voided, or if the gateway 
doesn't match.

=head1 EXAMPLE

Given 'returns.txt', which contains one authorization number on each 
line, provided by your default e-check processor:

  freeside-void-payments -f returns.txt -c -r 'Returned check'

If your default processor is Western ACH, which supports automated 
returns processing, this voids all returned payments since 2009-06-01:

  freeside-void-payments -r 'Returned check' -s 2009-06-01

This, in your crontab, will void returned payments for the last 
day at 8:30 every morning:

  30 8 * * * /usr/local/bin/freeside-void-payments -r 'Returned check'

=head1 BUGS

Most payment gateways don't support it, making the script largely useless.
