=head1 NAME

FS::svc_phone - Object methods for svc_phone records

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use FS::svc_phone;

  $record = new FS::svc_phone \%hash;
  $record = new FS::svc_phone { 'column' => 'value' };

  $error = $record->insert;

  $error = $new_record->replace($old_record);

  $error = $record->delete;

  $error = $record->check;

  $error = $record->suspend;

  $error = $record->unsuspend;

  $error = $record->cancel;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An FS::svc_phone object represents a phone number.  FS::svc_phone inherits
from FS::Record.  The following fields are currently supported:

=over 4

=item svcnum - primary key

=item countrycode - 

=item phonenum - 

=item pin - 

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new HASHREF

Creates a new phone number.  To add the number to the database, see L<"insert">.

Note that this stores the hash reference, not a distinct copy of the hash it
points to.  You can ask the object for a copy with the I<hash> method.

  {
    'name' => 'Phone number',
    'sorts' => 'phonenum',
    'display_weight' => 60,
    'cancel_weight'  => 80,
    'fields' => {
        'countrycode' => { label => 'Country code',

                         },
        'phonenum'    => 'Phone number',
        'pin'         => { label => 'Personal Identification Number',
                           type  => 'text',
                           disable_inventory => 1,

  };

sub table { 'svc_phone'; }

=item search_sql STRING

Class method which returns an SQL fragment to search for the given string.

=cut

sub search_sql {
  my( $class, $string ) = @_;
  $class->search_sql_field('phonenum', $string );
}

=item label

Returns the phone number.

=cut

sub label {
  my $self = shift;
  $self->phonenum; #XXX format it better
}

=item insert

Adds this record to the database.  If there is an error, returns the error,
otherwise returns false.

=cut

# the insert method can be inherited from FS::Record

=item delete

=cut

# the delete method can be inherited from FS::Record

=item replace OLD_RECORD

Replaces the OLD_RECORD with this one in the database.  If there is an error,
returns the error, otherwise returns false.

=cut

# the replace method can be inherited from FS::Record

=item suspend

Called by the suspend method of FS::cust_pkg (see L<FS::cust_pkg>).

=item unsuspend

Called by the unsuspend method of FS::cust_pkg (see L<FS::cust_pkg>).

=item cancel

Called by the cancel method of FS::cust_pkg (see L<FS::cust_pkg>).

=item check

Checks all fields to make sure this is a valid phone number.  If there is
an error, returns the error, otherwise returns false.  Called by the insert
and replace methods.

=cut

# the check method should currently be supplied - FS::Record contains some
# data checking routines

sub check {
  my $self = shift;

  my $error = 
    $self->ut_numbern('svcnum')
    || $self->ut_numbern('countrycode')
    || $self->ut_number('phonenum')
    || $self->ut_numbern('pin')
  ;
  return $error if $error;

  $self->countrycode(1) unless $self->countrycode;
