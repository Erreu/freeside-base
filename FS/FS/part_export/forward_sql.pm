Export mail forwards (svc_forward records) to SQL databases.

<BR><BR>In contrast to sqlmail, this is intended to export just svc_forward
records only, rather than a single export for svc_acct, svc_forward and
svc_domain records, to export in "default" database schemas rather than
configure the MTA or POP/IMAP server for a Freeside-specific schema, and
to be configured for different mail server setups.
