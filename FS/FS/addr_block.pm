=head1 NAME

FS::addr_block - Object methods for addr_block records

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use FS::addr_block;

  $record = new FS::addr_block \%hash;
  $record = new FS::addr_block { 'column' => 'value' };

  $error = $record->insert;

  $error = $new_record->replace($old_record);

  $error = $record->delete;

  $error = $record->check;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An FS::addr_block record describes an address block assigned for broadband 
access.  FS::addr_block inherits from FS::Record.  The following fields are 
currently supported:

=over 4

=item blocknum - primary key, used in FS::svc_broadband to associate 
services to the block.

=item routernum - the router (see FS::router) to which this 
block is assigned.

=item ip_gateway - the gateway address used by customers within this block.  

=item ip_netmask - the netmask of the block, expressed as an integer.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new HASHREF

Create a new record.  To add the record to the database, see "insert".

=cut

sub table { 'addr_block'; }

=item insert

Adds this record to the database.  If there is an error, returns the error,
otherwise returns false.

=item delete

Deletes this record from the database.  If there is an error, returns the
error, otherwise returns false.

sub delete {
  my $self = shift;
  return 'Block must be deallocated before deletion'
    if $self->router;

  $self->SUPER::delete;
}

=item replace OLD_RECORD

Replaces OLD_RECORD with this one in the database.  If there is an error,
returns the error, otherwise returns false.

=item check

Checks all fields to make sure this is a valid record.  If there is an error,
returns the error, otherwise returns false.  Called by the insert and replace
methods.

=cut

sub check {
  my $self = shift;

  my $error =
    $self->ut_number('routernum')
    || $self->ut_ip('ip_gateway')
    || $self->ut_number('ip_netmask')
  ;
  return $error if $error;


  # A routernum of 0 indicates an unassigned block and is allowed
  return "Unknown routernum"
    if ($self->routernum and not $self->router);

  my $self_addr = $self->NetAddr;
  return "Cannot parse address: ". $self->ip_gateway . '/' . $self->ip_netmask
    unless $self_addr;

  if (not $self->blocknum) {
    my @block = grep {
      my $block_addr = $_->NetAddr;
      if($block_addr->contains($self_addr) 
      or $self_addr->contains($block_addr)) { $_; };
    } qsearch( 'addr_block', {});
    foreach(@block) {
      return "Block intersects existing block ".$_->ip_gateway."/".$_->ip_netmask;
    }
  }

  $self->SUPER::check;
}


=item router

Returns the FS::router object corresponding to this object.  If the 
block is unassigned, returns undef.

=cut

sub router {
  my $self = shift;
  return qsearchs('router', { routernum => $self->routernum });
}

=item svc_broadband

Returns a list of FS::svc_broadband objects associated
with this object.

=cut

sub svc_broadband {
  my $self = shift;
  return qsearch('svc_broadband', { blocknum => $self->blocknum });
}

=item NetAddr

Returns a NetAddr::IP object for this block's address and netmask.

=cut

sub NetAddr {
  my $self = shift;

  return new NetAddr::IP ($self->ip_gateway, $self->ip_netmask);
}

=item next_free_addr

Returns a NetAddr::IP object corresponding to the first unassigned address 
in the block (other than the network, broadcast, or gateway address).  If 
there are no free addresses, returns false.

=cut

sub next_free_addr {
  my $self = shift;

  my $conf = new FS::Conf;
  my @excludeaddr = $conf->config('exclude_ip_addr');
  
  my @used = (
    map { $_->NetAddr->addr } 
      ($self, 
       qsearch('svc_broadband', { blocknum => $self->blocknum }) ),
     @excludeaddr );

  my @free = $self->NetAddr->hostenum;
  while (my $ip = shift @free) {
    if (not grep {$_ eq $ip->addr;} @used) { return $ip; };
  }

  '';

}

=item allocate

Allocates this address block to a router.  Takes an FS::router object 
as an argument.

At present it's not possible to reallocate a block to a different router 
except by deallocating it first, which requires that none of its addresses 
be assigned.  This is probably as it should be.

=cut

sub allocate {
  my ($self, $router) = @_;

  return 'Block is already allocated'
    if($self->router);

  return 'Block must be allocated to a router'
    unless(ref $router eq 'FS::router');

  my @svc = $self->svc_broadband;
  if (@svc) {
    return 'Block has assigned addresses: '. join ', ', map {$_->ip_addr} @svc;
  }

  my $new = new FS::addr_block {$self->hash};
  $new->routernum($router->routernum);
  return $new->replace($self);

}

=item deallocate

Deallocates the block (i.e. sets the routernum to 0).  If any addresses in the 
block are assigned to services, it fails.

=cut

sub deallocate {
  my $self = shift;

  my @svc = $self->svc_broadband;
  if (@svc) {
    return 'Block has assigned addresses: '. join ', ', map {$_->ip_addr} @svc;
  }

  my $new = new FS::addr_block {$self->hash};
  $new->routernum(0);
  return $new->replace($self);
}

=item split_block

Splits this address block into two equal blocks, occupying the same space as
the original block.  The first of the two will also have the same blocknum.
The gateway address of each block will be set to the first usable address, i.e.
(network address)+1.  Since this method is designed for use on unallocated
blocks, this is probably the correct behavior.

(At present, splitting allocated blocks is disallowed.  Anyone who wants to
implement this is reminded that each split costs three addresses, and any
customers who were using these addresses will have to be moved; depending on
how full the block was before being split, they might have to be moved to a
different block.  Anyone who I<still> wants to implement it is asked to tie it
to a configuration switch so that site admins can disallow it.)

  # sub that does more than one database operation.

  }

  $ip[0] = $self->NetAddr;
  @ip = map {$_->first()} $ip[0]->split($self->ip_netmask + 1);

  foreach (0,1) {
    $new[$_] = new FS::addr_block {$self->hash};
    $new[$_]->ip_gateway($ip[$_]->addr);
    $new[$_]->ip_netmask($ip[$_]->masklen);
  }

  $new[1]->blocknum('');

  $dbh->commit or die $dbh->errstr if $oldAutoCommit;
  return '';

=item merge

To be implemented.

=head1 BUGS

Minimum block size should be a config option.  It's hardcoded at /30 right
now because that's the smallest block that makes any sense at all.
