=head1 NAME

FS::reason - Object methods for reason records

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use FS::reason;

  $record = new FS::reason \%hash;
  $record = new FS::reason { 'column' => 'value' };

  $error = $record->insert;

  $error = $new_record->replace($old_record);

  $error = $record->delete;

  $error = $record->check;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An FS::reason object represents a reason message.  FS::reason inherits from
FS::Record.  The following fields are currently supported:

=over 4

=item reasonnum - primary key

=item reason_type - index into FS::reason_type

=item reason - text of the reason

=item disabled - 'Y' or ''

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new HASHREF

Creates a new reason.  To add the example to the database, see L<"insert">.

Note that this stores the hash reference, not a distinct copy of the hash it
points to.  You can ask the object for a copy with the I<hash> method.

=cut

sub table { 'reason'; }

=item insert

Adds this record to the database.  If there is an error, returns the error,
otherwise returns false.

=cut

=item delete

Delete this record from the database.

=cut

=item replace OLD_RECORD

Replaces the OLD_RECORD with this one in the database.  If there is an error,
returns the error, otherwise returns false.

=cut

=item check

Checks all fields to make sure this is a valid reason.  If there is
an error, returns the error, otherwise returns false.  Called by the insert
and replace methods.

=cut

sub check {
  my $self = shift;

  my $error = 
    $self->ut_numbern('reasonnum')
    || $self->ut_text('reason')
  ;
  return $error if $error;

  $self->SUPER::check;
}

=item reasontype

Returns the reason_type (see <I>FS::reason_type</I>) associated with this reason.

=cut

sub reasontype {
  qsearchs( 'reason_type', { 'typenum' => shift->reason_type } );
}
