Using Aegis for RT development

   1. The main line of RT development will be under the control
      of the Aegis change management system, as administered by
       Best Practical Solutions, LLC

   2. We will use aedist to generate change sets for each change
      checked in to the main Aegis repository. These change sets will be
      either distributed by a mailing list or made available via the web,
      or both.

   3. Remote developers using Aegis will send aedist output for
      their changes to rt-patches@bestpractical.com for review and
      integration.

   4. The aedist output should be sent to rt-patches@bestpractical.com
      after the change has completed its local aede, but before aerpass.

   5. If the change is rejected, the developer can aedeu to reopen
      the change and fix whatever problems caused the review to not pass.

   6. A baseline snapshot (aedist -bl) of the main Aegis repository
      will be generated at least daily and made available via http
      to provide a central location for synchronizing remote Aegis
      repositories.

   7. Changes to the main Aegis repository will also be propagated
      automatically to the tracking CVS repository.

Using CVS for RT development

   1. CVS is accessed via anonymous cvs with the following CVSROOT:

      :pserver:anoncvs@cvs.fsck.com:/raid/cvsroot/rt-2-1

   2. Remote developers using CVS will send patches (cvs -diff
      output) to rt-patches@bestpractical.com  for integration into the
      main Aegis repository. This allows anonymous CVS access to be used
      for RT development by developers who are unable to use Aegis.
