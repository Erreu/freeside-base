Handling a change set:

    --	Start the change:

		aedist -r	[if it's a remote submission]
                
                -or-

    		aedb {cnum}	[if it's initiated locally]

    --	Normal development cycle:

                aecd -c {cnum}                   
                aecp .          # Copy the baseline to your working dir
                # work on your change
                aenf {new file names}

                aecpu -unch   # Remove unchanged files, for faster diffs
    		aeb # Currently does nothing
		aet # Currently does nothing
		aed # Diff your change
		aede # End the change

    --	As the reviewer:
 
		aerpass {cnum}

    --	As the integrator:

		aeib {cnum}
		aeb
		aet
		aed
                cd ~ # Get out of the current working directory
		aeipass




    --	Update the aedist baseline on the web site:

		aedist -s -bl -p rt.2.1 > rt.2.1.ae
		scp rt.2.1.ae jesse@fsck.com:/home/ftp/pub/rt/devel/rt.2.1.ae
		rm rt.2.1.ae

	[This will eventually be automated.]

    --	Distribute the change to CVS:

        WARNING. DOES NOT YET WORK

		export CVS_RSH=ssh
    		ae2cvs -n -aegis -p rt.2.1 -c {cnum} -u ~/SCons/scons
    		ae2cvs -X -aegis -p rt.2.1 -c {cnum} -u ~/SCons/scons

        If you need the "ae2cvs" Perl script, you can find a copy
        checked in to the bin/subdirectory.

	[This may eventually be automated.]
