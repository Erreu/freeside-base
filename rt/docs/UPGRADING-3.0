UPGRADING FROM 3.0.x - Changes:

= Installation =

We recommend you move your existing /opt/rt3 tree completely out
of the way before installing the new version of RT, to make sure
that you don't inadvertently leave old files hanging around.

= Rights changes =

Now, if you want RT to automatically create new users upon ticket
submission, you MUST grant 'Everyone' the right to create tickets.
Granting this right only to "Unprivileged Users" is now insufficient.

= Web server configuration

The configuration for RT's web interface has changed.  Please refer to
docs/web_deployment.pod for instructions.
