RT2 makes everybody a user. some sites won't like this. there
should be away to make an "anonymous" user who the mailgate makes
the requestor for all mailed in tickets. it would then set the
ticket 'requestor' watcher's alternate email address to the real
requestor's email.

additionally, eventually, users will need to be deleted. RT doesn't
want any user deleted. Instead, there will be a flag in the user's
entry in the users table called 'Disabled.'  Disabled users will
not be able to be granted rights.

	The process of disabling a user should remove their acls and
should force the giving away of their tickets or reject the disabling.
