UPGRADING FROM 3.3.14 and earlier - Changes:

The "ModifyObjectCustomFieldValues" right name was too long. It has been
changed to "ModifyCustomField"


UPGRADING FROM 3.3.11 and earlier - Changes:

Custom Fields now have an additional right, "ModifyCustomField".  This
right governs whether a user can modify an object's custom field values
for a particular custom field. This includes adding, deleting and
changing values.
