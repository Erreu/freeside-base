<p>This page will be used to contain known issues and FAQ`s for the Statistics
package<br />
This will also be used to clarify limitations of the package as they stand.</p>

<p><strong>What Version of the Statistics package is this?</strong></p>
<p>0.1.8</p>

<p><strong>What time zone are the charts set to?</strong></p>
<p>Because of the new programming method of the date functions, the charts are currently built in GMT(UTC). This may once again be
customisable in a future release.</p>

<p><strong>What is the default date period and queue?</strong></p>
<p>The default date period is the previous 10 days, except where the chart is over a fixed 7 day period. The default queue is either
General, or another queue set in your local configuration.</p>

<p><strong>What are the limitations of the date function?</strong></p>
<p>It has few, but it will not let you chose less than one day. you cannot select an end date before the start date and it is not
recommended to select a date in the future or an illegal date, such at 30th February. Code has been put in place to trap these, but it may
not be fool proof.</p>
