=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 METHODS

=cut

package RT::GroupMember;
use RT::Record; 


use vars qw( @ISA );
@ISA= qw( RT::Record );

sub _Init {
  my $self = shift; 

  $self->Table('GroupMembers');
  $self->SUPER::_Init(@_);
}





=item Create PARAMHASH

Create takes a hash of values and creates a row in the database:

  int(11) 'GroupId'.
  int(11) 'MemberId'.

=cut

    my $self = shift;
    my %args = ( 
                GroupId => '0',
                MemberId => '0',

		  @_);
    $self->SUPER::Create(
                         GroupId => $args{'GroupId'},
                         MemberId => $args{'MemberId'},
);

}



=item id

Returns the current value of id. 
(In the database, id is stored as int(11).)


=cut


=item GroupId

Returns the current value of GroupId. 
(In the database, GroupId is stored as int(11).)



=item SetGroupId VALUE

Returns (1, 'Status message') on success and (0, 'Error Message') on failure.
(In the database, GroupId will be stored as a int(11).)


=cut


=item MemberId

=head1 SEE ALSO

This class allows "overlay" methods to be placed
into the following files _Overlay is for a System overlay by the original author,
_Vendor is for 3rd-party vendor add-ons, while _Local is for site-local customizations.  

These overlay files can contain new subs or subs to replace existing subs in this module.

If you'll be working with perl 5.6.0 or greater, each of these files should begin with the line 

   no warnings qw(redefine);

so that perl does not kick and scream when you redefine a subroutine or variable in your overlay.

RT::GroupMember_Overlay, RT::GroupMember_Vendor, RT::GroupMember_Local
