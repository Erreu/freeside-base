=head1 NAME 

RT::System

=head1 DESCRIPTION

RT::System is a simple global object used as a focal point for things
that are system-wide.

It works sort of like an RT::Record, except it's really a single object that has
an id of "1" when instantiated.

This gets used by the ACL system so that you can have rights for the scope "RT::System"

In the future, there will probably be other API goodness encapsulated here.

=cut


package RT::System;

use strict;
use warnings;
use base qw/RT::Record/;

use RT::ACL;

# System rights are rights granted to the whole system
# XXX TODO Can't localize these outside of having an object around.
our $RIGHTS = {
    SuperUser              => 'Do anything and everything',           # loc_pair
    AdminAllPersonalGroups =>
      "Create, delete and modify the members of any user's personal groups", # loc_pair
    AdminOwnPersonalGroups =>
      'Create, delete and modify the members of personal groups',     # loc_pair
    AdminUsers     => 'Create, delete and modify users',              # loc_pair
    ModifySelf     => "Modify one's own RT account",                  # loc_pair
    DelegateRights =>
      "Delegate specific rights which have been granted to you.",     # loc_pair
    ShowConfigTab => "show Configuration tab",     # loc_pair
    ShowApprovalsTab => "show Approvals tab",     # loc_pair
    LoadSavedSearch => "allow loading of saved searches",     # loc_pair
    CreateSavedSearch => "allow creation of saved searches",      # loc_pair
};

# Tell RT::ACE that this sort of object can get acls granted
$RT::ACE::OBJECT_TYPES{'RT::System'} = 1;

foreach my $right ( keys %{$RIGHTS} ) {
    $RT::ACE::LOWERCASERIGHTNAMES{ lc $right } = $right;
}


=head2 AvailableRights

Returns a hash of available rights for this object.
The keys are the right names and the values are a
description of what the rights do.

This method as well returns rights of other RT objects,
like L<RT::Queue> or L<RT::Group>. To allow users to apply
those rights globally.

=cut


use RT::CustomField;
use RT::Queue;
use RT::Group; 
sub AvailableRights {
    my $self = shift;

    my $queue = RT::Queue->new($RT::SystemUser);
    my $group = RT::Group->new($RT::SystemUser);
    my $cf    = RT::CustomField->new($RT::SystemUser);

    my $qr = $queue->AvailableRights();
    my $gr = $group->AvailableRights();
    my $cr = $cf->AvailableRights();

    # Build a merged list of all system wide rights, queue rights and group rights.
    my %rights = (%{$RIGHTS}, %{$gr}, %{$qr}, %{$cr});

    return(\%rights);
}

=head2 AddRights C<RIGHT>, C<DESCRIPTION> [, ...]

Adds the given rights to the list of possible rights.  This method
should be called during server startup, not at runtime.

=cut

sub AddRights {
    my $self = shift if ref $_[0] or $_[0] eq __PACKAGE__;
    my %new = @_;
    $RIGHTS = { %$RIGHTS, %new };
    %RT::ACE::LOWERCASERIGHTNAMES = ( %RT::ACE::LOWERCASERIGHTNAMES,
                                      map { lc($_) => $_ } keys %new);
}

sub _Init {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->SUPER::_Init (@_) if @_ && $_[0];
}

=head2 id

Returns RT::System's id. It's 1. 

=cut

*Id = \&id;
sub id { return 1 }

=head2 Load

Since this object is pretending to be an RT::Record, we need a load method.
It does nothing

=cut

sub Load    { return 1 }
sub Name    { return 'RT System' }
sub __Set   { return 0 }
sub __Value { return 0 }
sub Create  { return 0 }
sub Delete  { return 0 }

sub SubjectTag {
    my $self = shift;
    my $queue = shift;

    my $map = $self->FirstAttribute('BrandedSubjectTag');
    $map = $map->Content if $map;
    return $queue ? undef : () unless $map;

    return $map->{ $queue->id } if $queue;

    my %seen = ();
    return grep !$seen{lc $_}++, values %$map;
}

=head2 QueueCacheNeedsUpdate ( 1 )

Attribute to decide when SelectQueue needs to flush the list of queues
  and retrieve new ones.  Set when queues are created, enabled/disabled
  and on certain acl changes.  Should also better understand group management.

If passed a true value, will update the attribute to be the current time.

=cut

sub QueueCacheNeedsUpdate {
    my $self = shift;
    my $update = shift;

    if ($update) {
        return $self->SetAttribute(Name => 'QueueCacheNeedsUpdate', Content => time);
    } else {
        my $cache = $self->FirstAttribute('QueueCacheNeedsUpdate');
        return (defined $cache ? $cache->Content : 0 );
    }
}
