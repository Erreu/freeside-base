=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 METHODS

=cut

package RT::Principal;
use RT::Record; 


use vars qw( @ISA );
@ISA= qw( RT::Record );

sub _Init {
  my $self = shift; 

  $self->Table('Principals');
  $self->SUPER::_Init(@_);
}





=item Create PARAMHASH

Create takes a hash of values and creates a row in the database:

  varchar(16) 'PrincipalType'.
  int(11) 'ObjectId'.
  smallint(6) 'Disabled'.

=cut




sub Create {
    my $self = shift;
    my %args = ( 
                PrincipalType => '',
                ObjectId => '',
                Disabled => '0',

		  @_);
    $self->SUPER::Create(
                         PrincipalType => $args{'PrincipalType'},
                         ObjectId => $args{'ObjectId'},
                         Disabled => $args{'Disabled'},
);

}



=item id

Returns the current value of id. 
(In the database, id is stored as int(11).)


=cut


=item PrincipalType

Returns the current value of PrincipalType. 
(In the database, PrincipalType is stored as varchar(16).)



=item SetPrincipalType VALUE


Set PrincipalType to VALUE. 
Returns (1, 'Status message') on success and (0, 'Error Message') on failure.
(In the database, PrincipalType will be stored as a varchar(16).)


=cut


=item ObjectId

Returns the current value of ObjectId. 
(In the database, ObjectId is stored as int(11).)



=item SetObjectId VALUE


Set ObjectId to VALUE. 
Returns (1, 'Status message') on success and (0, 'Error Message') on failure.
(In the database, ObjectId will be stored as a int(11).)


=cut


=item Disabled

Returns the current value of Disabled. 
(In the database, Disabled is stored as smallint(6).)



=item SetDisabled VALUE


Set Disabled to VALUE. 
Returns (1, 'Status message') on success and (0, 'Error Message') on failure.
(In the database, Disabled will be stored as a smallint(6).)

=head1 SEE ALSO

This class allows "overlay" methods to be placed
into the following files _Overlay is for a System overlay by the original author,
_Vendor is for 3rd-party vendor add-ons, while _Local is for site-local customizations.  

These overlay files can contain new subs or subs to replace existing subs in this module.

If you'll be working with perl 5.6.0 or greater, each of these files should begin with the line 

   no warnings qw(redefine);

so that perl does not kick and scream when you redefine a subroutine or variable in your overlay.

RT::Principal_Overlay, RT::Principal_Vendor, RT::Principal_Local
