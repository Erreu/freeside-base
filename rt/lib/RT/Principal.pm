RT::Principal


=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 METHODS

=cut

package RT::Principal;
use RT::Record; 


use vars qw( @ISA );
@ISA= qw( RT::Record );

sub _Init {
  my $self = shift; 

  $self->Table('Principals');
  $self->SUPER::_Init(@_);
}





=head2 Create PARAMHASH

Create takes a hash of values and creates a row in the database:

  varchar(16) 'PrincipalType'.
  int(11) 'ObjectId'.
  smallint(6) 'Disabled'.

=cut




sub Create {
    my $self = shift;
    my %args = ( 
                PrincipalType => '',
                ObjectId => '',
                Disabled => '0',

		  @_);
    $self->SUPER::Create(
                         PrincipalType => $args{'PrincipalType'},
                         ObjectId => $args{'ObjectId'},
                         Disabled => $args{'Disabled'},
);

}



=head2 id

Returns the current value of id. 
(In the database, id is stored as int(11).)


=cut


=head2 PrincipalType

Returns the current value of PrincipalType. 
(In the database, PrincipalType is stored as varchar(16).)



=head2 SetPrincipalType VALUE


Set PrincipalType to VALUE. 
Returns (1, 'Status message') on success and (0, 'Error Message') on failure.
(In the database, PrincipalType will be stored as a varchar(16).)


=cut


=head2 ObjectId

Returns the current value of ObjectId. 
(In the database, ObjectId is stored as int(11).)



=head2 SetObjectId VALUE


Set ObjectId to VALUE. 
Returns (1, 'Status message') on success and (0, 'Error Message') on failure.
(In the database, ObjectId will be stored as a int(11).)


=cut


=head2 Disabled

Returns the current value of Disabled. 
(In the database, Disabled is stored as smallint(6).)



=head2 SetDisabled VALUE


Set Disabled to VALUE. 
Returns (1, 'Status message') on success and (0, 'Error Message') on failure.
(In the database, Disabled will be stored as a smallint(6).)

=head1 SEE ALSO

This class allows "overlay" methods to be placed
into the following files _Overlay is for a System overlay by the original author,
_Vendor is for 3rd-party vendor add-ons, while _Local is for site-local customizations.  

These overlay files can contain new subs or subs to replace existing subs in this module.

Each of these files should begin with the line 

   no warnings qw(redefine);

so that perl does not kick and scream when you redefine a subroutine or variable in your overlay.

RT::Principal_Overlay, RT::Principal_Vendor, RT::Principal_Local
