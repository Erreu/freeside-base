# {{ Create

=head2 Create PARAMHASH

Create takes a hash of values and creates a row in the database:

  'Group' is the "top level" group we're building the cache for. This 
  is an RT::Principal object

  'Member' is the RT::Principal  of the user or group we're adding to 
  the cache.

  'ImmediateParent' is the RT::Principal of the group that this 
  principal belongs to to get here

  int(11) 'Via' is an internal reference to CachedGroupMembers->Id of
  the "parent" record of this cached group member. It should be empty if 
  this member is a "direct" member of this group. (In that case, it will 
  be set to this cached group member's id after creation)

  This routine should _only_ be called by GroupMember->Create
