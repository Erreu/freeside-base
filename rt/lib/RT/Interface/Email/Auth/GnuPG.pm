=head2 GetCurrentUser

To use the gnupg-secured mail gateway, you need to do the following:

Set up a gnupgp key directory with a pubring containing only the keys
you care about and specify the following in your SiteConfig.pm

Set($RT::GPGKeyDir, "/path/to/keyring-directory");
@RT::MailPlugins = qw(Auth::MailFrom Auth::GnuPG Filter::TakeAction);
