=head1 NAME

RT - Request Tracker

=head1 SYNOPSIS

A fully featured request tracker package

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 LoadConfig

Load RT's config file.  First, the site configuration file
(C<RT_SiteConfig.pm>) is loaded, in order to establish overall site
settings like hostname and name of RT instance.  Then, the core
configuration file (C<RT_Config.pm>) is loaded to set fallback values
for all settings; it bases some values on settings from the site
configuration file.

In order for the core configuration to not override the site's
settings, the function C<Set> is used; it only sets values if they
have not been set already.

     local *Set = sub { $_[0] = $_[1] unless defined $_[0] };

    }
    require $CORE_CONFIG_FILE
      || die ("Couldn't load RT config file '$CORE_CONFIG_FILE'\n$@");
    RT::I18N->Init;
}

=head2 Init
