FS::SignupClient - Freeside signup client API

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use FS::SignupClient qw( signup_info new_customer );

  #this is compatible with FS::SelfService::new_customer
  $error = new_customer ( {

    'last'             => $last,

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an API for a remote signup server.

It needs to be run as the freeside user.  Because of this, the program which
calls these subroutines should be written very carefully.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=over 4

=item signup_info

Returns three array references of hash references.

The first set of hash references is of allowable locales.  Each hash reference
has the following keys:
  taxnum
  state
  county
  country

The second set of hash references is of allowable packages.  Each hash
reference has the following keys:
  pkgpart
  pkg

The third set of hash references is of allowable POPs (Points Of Presence).
Each hash reference has the following keys:
  popnum
  city
  state
  ac
  exch

(Future expansion: fourth argument is the $init_data hash reference)

sub signup_info {

  my $init_data = FS::SelfService::signup_info();

  (map { $init_data->{$_} } qw( cust_main_county part_pkg svc_acct_pop ) ),
  $init_data;

}

=item new_customer HASHREF

Adds a customer to the remote Freeside system.  Requires a hash reference as
a paramater with the following keys:
  first
