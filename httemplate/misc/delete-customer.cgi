#Deleting a customer you have financial records on (i.e. credits) is
#typically considered fraudulant bookkeeping.  Remember, deleting   
#customers should ONLY be used for completely bogus records.  You should
#NOT delete real customers who simply discontinue service.
#
#For real customers who simply discontinue service, cancel all of the
#customer's packages.  Customers with all cancelled packages are not  
#billed.  There is no need to take further action to prevent billing on
#customers with all cancelled packages.
#
#Also see the "hidecancelledcustomers" and "hidecancelledpackages"
#configuration options, which will allow you to surpress the display of
#cancelled customers and packages, respectively.
