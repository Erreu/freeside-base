  <h1>Unattended SSH</h1>
  <br><a name=ssh>Unattended remote login</a> - Freeside can login to remote machines unattended using SSH.  This can pose a security risk if not configured correctly, and will allow an intruder who breaks into your freeside machine full access to your remote machines.  <b>Do not use this feature unless you understand what you are doing!</b>
    <ul>
      <li>As the freeside user (on your freeside machine), generate an authentication key using <a href="http://www.tac.eu.org/cgi-bin/man-cgi?ssh-keygen+1">ssh-keygen</a>.  Since this is for unattended operation, use a blank passphrase.
      <li>Append the newly-created <code>identity.pub</code> file to <code>~root/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> (or the appopriate <code>~username/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>) on the remote machine(s).
      <li>Some new SSH v2 implementation accept v2 style keys only.  Use the <code>-t</code> option to <a href="http://www.tac.eu.org/cgi-bin/man-cgi?ssh-keygen+1">ssh-keygen</a>, and append the created <code>id_dsa.pub</code> or <code>id_rsa.pub</code> to <code>~root/.ssh/authorized_keys2</code> (or the appopriate <code>~username/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>) on the remote machine(s).
      <li>You may need to set <code>PermitRootLogin without-password</code> (meaning with keys only) in your <code>sshd_config</code> file on the remote machine(s).
    </ul>
