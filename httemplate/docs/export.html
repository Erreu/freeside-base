  <h1>Exports</h1>
  <p>Exports allow you to provision services to remote machines, databases and
  APIs.  Some exports, such as <b>sqlradius</b> and
  <b>sqlradius_withdomain</b>, enable a feed for retreiving rating/usage data.
  <p>Exports can be added and edited under
     <a href="../browse/part_export.cgi"><i>Sysadmin | View/Edit Exports</i></a>.
  <p>Selecting an export on the
     <a href="../edit/part_export.cgi"><i>Sysadmin | View/Edit Exports | Add a new export</i></a> page will
     show more information on that specific export, including available
     options, setup and usage.
  <p>Exports are activated by associating them with one or more service
     definitions: <a href="../browse/part_svc.cgi"><i>Sysadmin | View/Edit Service definitions<i></a>.
