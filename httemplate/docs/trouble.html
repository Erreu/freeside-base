  <h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>When troubleshooting the web interface, helpful information is often in your web server's error log.
    <li>If bin/svc_acct.import fails with an "Out of memory!" error using MySQL, upgrede MySQL and recompile the Perl DBD.  There was a memory leak in some older versions of MySQL.
    <li>If you get tons of errors in your web server's error log like this:
<pre>
Ambiguous use of value => resolved to "value" =>
at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/File/CounterFile.pm line 132.
</pre>
        This clutters up your log files but is otherwise harmless.  Upgrade to the latest File::CounterFile. 
    <li>If you get errors like this:
<pre>
UID.pm: Can't open /var/spool/freeside/conf/secrets: Permission denied 
at <i>/your/path</i>/site_perl/FS/UID.pm line 26.
BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at
<i>/your/path</i>/edit/process/part_svc.cgi line 15.
</pre>
        Then the scripts are not running as the freeside freeside user.  See
the <a href="install.html">New Installation</a> section of the documentation.
  <li>If you receive `can not connect to server' errors using MySQL on a system that doesn't support native threading, you may need to specify the full hostname in your DBI datasource.  See the <a href="http://www.mysql.com/Manual_chapter/manual_Problems.html#Can_not_connect_to_server">MySQL documentation</a>, DBI manpage and the DBD::mysql manpage for details.
  </ul>
