  <li>Open up the root of the Freeside document tree in your web
  browser.  For example, if you created the Freeside document tree in   
  /home/httpd/html/freeside, and your web browser's DocumentRoot is
  /home/httpd/html, open https://your_host/freeside/. Replace
  "your_host" with the name or network address of your web server.
  <li>Select <u>Configuration</u> from the main menu and update your configuration values.

  <li>Go to <u>View/Edit service definitions</u> on the main menu, and
  <u>Add a new service definition</u> with <i>Table</i> <b>svc_acct</b>.
  Select your domain in the <b>domsvc</b> Modifier.  Set <b>Fixed</b> to define
  a service locked-in to this domain, or <b>Default</b> to define a service
  which may select from among this domain and the customer's domains.

  <li><table><tr>
    <td> Create at least POP (Point of Presence) by selecting
        <u>View/Edit POPs</u> from the main menu.</td>

    <td>If you are not doing dialup, set slipip to fixed and blank for all your

  <li>If you are using Freeside to keep track of sales taxes, define tax
  information for your locales by clicking on the <u>View/Edit locales and tax
  rates</u> on the main menu.

  <li>If you would like Freeside to notify your customers when their credit
  cards and other billing arrangements are about to expire, arrange for
  <b>freeside-expiration-alerter</b> to be run daily by cron or similar
  facility.  The message it sends can be configured from the
  <u>Configuration</u> choice of the main menu as <u>alerter_template</u>.
