	  will then pick it up, allowing multiple simultaneous jobs to run,
	  as well as multiple machines.  Also adds a 'Secure' column to the
	  queue system, allowing for billing jobs to define themselves as
	  'secure only' in cases where a box might be using the encryption.
	  This allows you to  run secure only jobs (such as a collect) on
	  boxes that can.

	  ---- before and after now?  I gave subscription and prorate a

	    subscription 27th (03/25/06 - 04/27/06)  $10.00
	    subscription 23rd (03/25/06 - 04/23/06)  $10.00

	  the "23rd" one is right, but the "27th" one should have only
	  advanced the date two days to 3/27/06.

	      Prorate came out as:

	      prorate 23rd (03/25/06 - 04/23/06)  $9.20
	      prorate 27th (03/25/06 - 04/27/06)  $10.49

	  The "23rd" one is right, but the "27th" one should have only
	  advanced the date two days to 4/27/06.

2006-03-23 04:00  lsc

	* FS/FS/part_pkg/: prorate.pm, subscription.pm: for subscription.pm
	  and prorate.pm:

	  -modify the subscription and prorate price plans
	  (FS/FS/part_pkg/subscription.pm and prorate.pm) to have a
	  configurable (add a field to the %info hash) billing day instead
	  of "1st of the month" only.  subscription will be easy, prorate
	  will be a little trickier.

	  essentially, I replaced the '1' in the 'day' field of the
	  timelocal that generates $$date with the value I added to the
	  %info hash, 'cutoff_day'

	  -implement a price plan (new file in FS/FS/part_pkg/ - probably
	  @ISA FS::part_pkg::subscription) that charges the first full
	  month if the customer signs up between the 1st and the
	  configurable billing day, and gives them the remainder of the
	  month free if they sign up between the configurable billing day
	  and the end of the month.

	  if this is the first time the customer is billed, and if the date
	  is greater than the cutoff date, advance $ssdate to cutoff_day of
	  next month, else $$date is cutoff_date of this month.  Either
	  way, charge them for a month.
