	* install/rpm/: freeside-mason.deps.inc, freeside.spec: Ugly hack
	  to extend rpmbuild's auto-requires to process handler.pl.  This
	  is loosely based on notes on the Fedora wiki.  The internal
	  dependency generator is disabled and as far as possible the same
	  code is used to generate provides and requires.  The list of
	  files to be scanned for requires is saved by a supplemental
	  script and if it contains handler.pl, that file is scanned for
	  requires with the standard Perl dependencies checker.  References
	  to RT are filtered out as RT is not enabled in this version of
	  the .spec file.  This mod obsoletes the freeside-mason-deps.inc
	  file and simplifies building the RPMs.

	* install/rpm/freeside.spec: Ugly hack to make MySQL work.  The

	    subscription 23rd (03/25/06 - 04/23/06)  $10.00

	  the "23rd" one is right, but the "27th" one should have only

	      Prorate came out as:

	      prorate 23rd (03/25/06 - 04/23/06)  $9.20
	      prorate 27th (03/25/06 - 04/27/06)  $10.49

	  The "23rd" one is right, but the "27th" one should have only
	  advanced the date two days to 4/27/06.

	* FS/FS/part_pkg/: prorate.pm, subscription.pm: for subscription.pm
	  and prorate.pm:

	  -modify the subscription and prorate price plans
	  (FS/FS/part_pkg/subscription.pm and prorate.pm) to have a
	  configurable (add a field to the %info hash) billing day instead
	  of "1st of the month" only.  subscription will be easy, prorate
	  will be a little trickier.

	  essentially, I replaced the '1' in the 'day' field of the
	  timelocal that generates $$date with the value I added to the
	  %info hash, 'cutoff_day'

	  -implement a price plan (new file in FS/FS/part_pkg/ - probably
	  @ISA FS::part_pkg::subscription) that charges the first full
	  month if the customer signs up between the 1st and the
	  configurable billing day, and gives them the remainder of the
	  month free if they sign up between the configurable billing day
	  and the end of the month.

	  if this is the first time the customer is billed, and if the date
	  is greater than the cutoff date, advance $ssdate to cutoff_day of
	  next month, else $$date is cutoff_date of this month.  Either
	  way, charge them for a month.
