	* install/rpm/: freeside-mason.deps.inc, freeside.spec: Ugly hack
	  to extend rpmbuild's auto-requires to process handler.pl.  This
	  is loosely based on notes on the Fedora wiki.  The internal
	  dependency generator is disabled and as far as possible the same
	  code is used to generate provides and requires.  The list of
	  files to be scanned for requires is saved by a supplemental
	  script and if it contains handler.pl, that file is scanned for
	  requires with the standard Perl dependencies checker.  References
	  to RT are filtered out as RT is not enabled in this version of
	  the .spec file.  This mod obsoletes the freeside-mason-deps.inc
	  file and simplifies building the RPMs.
