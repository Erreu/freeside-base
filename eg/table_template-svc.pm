=head1 NAME

FS::table_name - Object methods for table_name records

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use FS::table_name;

  $record = new FS::table_name \%hash;
  $record = new FS::table_name { 'column' => 'value' };

  $error = $record->insert;

  $error = $new_record->replace($old_record);

  $error = $record->delete;

  $error = $record->check;

  $error = $record->suspend;

  $error = $record->unsuspend;

  $error = $record->cancel;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An FS::table_name object represents an example.  FS::table_name inherits from
FS::svc_Common.  The following fields are currently supported:

=over 4

=item field - description

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new HASHREF

Creates a new example.  To add the example to the database, see L<"insert">.

Note that this stores the hash reference, not a distinct copy of the hash it
points to.  You can ask the object for a copy with the I<hash> method.

=cut

sub table { 'table_name'; }

=item insert

Adds this record to the database.  If there is an error, returns the error,
otherwise returns false.

The additional fields pkgnum and svcpart (see L<FS::cust_svc>) should be 
defined.  An FS::cust_svc record will be created and inserted.

=cut

sub insert {
  my $self = shift;
  my $error;

  $error = $self->SUPER::insert;
  return $error if $error;

  '';
}

=item delete

Delete this record from the database.

=cut

sub delete {
  my $self = shift;
  my $error;

  $error = $self->SUPER::delete;
  return $error if $error;

  '';
}


=item replace OLD_RECORD

Replaces the OLD_RECORD with this one in the database.  If there is an error,
returns the error, otherwise returns false.

=cut

sub replace {
  my ( $new, $old ) = ( shift, shift );
  my $error;

  $error = $new->SUPER::replace($old);
  return $error if $error;

  '';
}

=item suspend

Called by the suspend method of FS::cust_pkg (see L<FS::cust_pkg>).

=item unsuspend

Called by the unsuspend method of FS::cust_pkg (see L<FS::cust_pkg>).

=item cancel

Called by the cancel method of FS::cust_pkg (see L<FS::cust_pkg>).

=item check

Checks all fields to make sure this is a valid example.  If there is
an error, returns the error, otherwise returns false.  Called by the insert
and repalce methods.

=cut

sub check {
  my $self = shift;

  my $x = $self->setfixed;
  return $x unless ref($x);
  my $part_svc = $x;


  ''; #no error
}
