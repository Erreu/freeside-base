  AuthUserFile is wrong (just fucked)

test its working) somes sort of Alias /freeside /usr/share/freeside/www is needed

test in postinst) freeside package var/cache/freeside/cache.<datasrc is missing>

test RT is missing.  doh.  get it working.

test actually installing!

--- rc2... right? ---

freeside-selfservice-client doesn't install at all

start freeside-sqlradius-radacctd from /etc/default/freeside too

Added to README.Debian... do something else?
Ensure apache is set to run as User freeside.

init script doesn't need to add /usr/local/bin.  could start over from 
init.d.ex or init.d.lsb.ex

finish 

RT install locations (or for now: disable for unstable, enable for
experiemental.  but try to get it finished off in time for lenny)
